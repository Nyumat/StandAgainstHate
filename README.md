## Introduction

I made Stand Against Hate for my final project of the course WGSS110, Gender, Race, and Pop Culture. The goal of the website is to provide a hub for combating hate crime and any other forms of discrimincation/hate in my community. 


As we know, fighting against hate crimes in America requires a concerted effort by individuals, communities, and authorities. With Stand Against Hate, we can work together and take action, creating safer and more inclusive communities for everyone.
